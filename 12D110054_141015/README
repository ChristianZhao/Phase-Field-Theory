The input file is made as follows

***********input.dat****************
n: number of dislocations
D: size of the matrix
nsteps: number of time steps
dxmax: maximum movement of a dislocation in a single time step
fscanf(f,"%d",&n);
fscanf(f,"%d",&D);
fscanf(f,"%le",&nsteps);
fscanf(f,"%le",&dxmax)
************************************

***********INSTRUCTIONS****************
just use
./run.sh
to compile,run and main.c and to see a plot of the profiles

***********RESULTS****************
All like dislocations converge and form a cluster and in the end you see bands of dislocations having alternate sign of bergers vector
