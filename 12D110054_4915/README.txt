The input file is made as follows

***********input.dat****************
n_x(number of nodes)
delta_x
T(number of time steps)
delta_t
T_write(number of time steps after which the profile in saved)
A
alpha
beta
************************************

***********INSTRUCTIONS****************
just use
./run.sh
to compile,run and main.c and to see a animation of the profile with time

./runAnalysis.sh
to compile and run analysis.c and to see a plot of the velocity and Interface Position Vs Time

***********RESULTS****************
The velocity exponentially decreases with time as the profile reaches steady state
the interface position also exponentially moves towards the steady state position of the interface
