delta_x
n_y(number of nodes)
delta_y
T(number of time steps)
delta_t
T_write(number of time steps after which the profile in saved)
alpha
beta
A
************************************

***********INSTRUCTIONS****************
just use
./run.sh
to compile,run and main.c and to see a animation of the profile with time
