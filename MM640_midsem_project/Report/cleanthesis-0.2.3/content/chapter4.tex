\chapter{Summary}

BMGs have an interesting combination of properties. They exhibit very high strength, large elastic elongations, low Youngâ€™s modulus, good corrosion resistance, and the ability to be easily formed in the supercooled liquid state. Coupled with the fact that these materials do not have a crystal structure and consequently no grains and grain boundaries, the surface finish is extremely smooth. Such a fine texture has earlier been possible only in polymeric materials and oxide glasses. Thus, the potential applications for these materials seem to be unlimited.
