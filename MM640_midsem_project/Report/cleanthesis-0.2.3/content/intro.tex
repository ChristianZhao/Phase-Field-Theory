\chapter{Introduction}

This is a part reproduction of the paper \textbf{"Phase field study of grain boundary effects on spinodal decomposition, Acta Materialia, 2003"}  by H. Ramanarayan, T.A. Abinandanan of Department of Metallurgy, IISc, Bangalore, India.
The authors of the above mentioned paper developed a phase field model of a polycrystalline binary alloy by combining the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The \textbf{Cahn–Hilliard} model(for conserved variables) for a compositionally inhomogeneous alloy.
\item A model of polycrystals (Fan D, Chen L-Q. Acta Mater. 1997;45:3297) which is governed by the Cahn–Allen equation for non-conserved variables 
 \end{enumerate} 

Further, this Model was used to study grain boundary (GB) effects on spinodal decomposition (SD) in two-dimensional (2D) systems. \\
This report goes throught the explanantion of the Model developed and the implementation of the simulations(codes attached) together with an comparison of results obtained in the paper with those obtained in the reproduction.
