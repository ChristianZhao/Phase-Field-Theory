\chapter{Pseudo Code}
This is the general code for which minor changes are made to get the complete results.
\begin{verbatim}
Take input from file input.dat
n_x, delta_x, n_y, delta_y, T, delta_t, T_write
(after how many steps do we print the output in a file)
Declare composition,n1,n2,g,h1 & h2 matrix and Allocate memory
Declare the Fourier Transform's respectively

Calculate half_nx, half_ny, delta_kx & delta_ky

Make the Initial Profile
Traverse the matrix
      Generate Random Number R=[-1,1]
      composition=0.5 +- R*0.04
			IF i<half_nx
			   n1=1 & n2=0
			ELSE
        	   n1=0 & n2=1
Start time loop
Traverse Matrix
Calculate g,h1,h2
Take composition,n1,n2,g,h1 & h2 to Fourier space
Evolve composition    
Traverse Matrix
        	Calculate kx,ky
        	Calculate new composition,n1 & n2 -- 
    	Take composition,n1 & n2 back to real space
    	Traverse Matrix
        Normalise the values and Set imaginary part to zero 
        for composition,n1 & n2
    After every T_write time steps write composition profile to file
end time loop
Free all memory
